### Project Structure
  
* **model**: Model implementation
* **gwt**: GWT implementation
* **test**: Development tests and samples

#### Pre-requisites for building the project:
* Maven, version 3+
* Java JDK 11
* This [settings.xml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pentaho/maven-parent-poms/master/maven-support-files/settings.xml) in your <user-home>/.m2 directory

#### Building it

This is a maven project, and to build it use the following command

```
$ mvn clean install
```

Optionally you can specify -Dmaven.test.skip=true to skip the tests (even though
you shouldn't as you know)

The build result will be a Pentaho package located in ```target```.

#### Running the tests

__Unit tests__

This will run all unit tests in the project (and sub-modules).

```
$ mvn test
```

If you want to remote debug a single java unit test (default port is 5005):

```
$ cd core
$ mvn test -Dtest=<<YourTest>> -Dmaven.surefire.debug
```

To skip test

```
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests
```

To get log as text file

```
$ mvn clean install test >log.txt
```
